# Repository Structure #

|**master** branchh | lastest stable version, safe for production usage|
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| **development** branch | cutting edge version with latest additions. Could contain bugs, be careful! |

### Working on issues/features ###
When working on an issue, a new branch named issues/`issue_number` should be created if yout want to sync WIP code to the repository.

This "feature branches" are just for internal development use though, and probably will not be safe for an end user.
Once an issue is fixed/finished it will be merged into the development branch.
